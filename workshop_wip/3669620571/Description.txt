I've been working on a mod to reduce burn in during the game especially for OLED monitors.

UPDATE: There were a few textures i was originally unable to modify, but i have now found the right place to modify these. So the mod should be a complete adjustment of all textures that show now. Please let me know in the comments if any others appear at different stages of the game and i can look at these too.

Installation:

1. Subscribe to the mod

2. Right click on the game in Steam, select Manage > Show Local files. You will be taken to the game folder, usually '\steamapps\common\Soviet Republic\media_soviet'.

3. You can back up the original Media_Soviet\editor and Media_Soviet\notification folders first if you want to so this can be reversed without having to verify files or reinstall. 

4. Find the folder with the mod. To do this, open another window with the same address that you have open now, then go up a few levels to the folder '\steamapps\', then go to the subfolder with the mod
\steamapps\workshop\content\784150\3669620571

5. Copy the files from the editor.zip and notification.zip files in the mod folder into the Media_Soviet\editor and Media_Soviet/notification folders of your game install  (in your other window). Overwrite the existing ones.

6. In the game options set your left menu and bottom build menu to be collapsible

I have not been able to adjust a few things.
1. The textbox backgrounds on the top menu. It's possible they are hard coded.
2. Two of the icons and the backgrounds for the area in the bottom right.

Will it help with burn in?
Yes considering if your left and bottom menu are collapsible, the strip of graphics that remain are now not as bright
The bright images from the top menu are now a lot less bright.
Same goes for the coloured icons and images for the bottom right toolbox.
 

NOTE: It is possible if the mod stops working after each update you may need to repeat the copy process from the mod foler to the game folder.
